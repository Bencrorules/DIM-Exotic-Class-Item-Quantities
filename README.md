# DIM-Exotic-Armor-CSV
 Takes in DIM armor CSV and outputs three sorted CSVs of each exotic class item. Good for duplicate analysis or completionist analysis.

To run, download an up to date DIM CSV (Settings -> Spreadsheets -> Armor)

Run 'Vault Scrubbing.py' with Python 3 or newer in the same directory as the downloaded file (ensure downloaded DIM filename is 'destinyArmor.csv')

Three CSVs for each exotic class item will be generated denoting how many of each perk combination are in your vault.
